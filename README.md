# DecisionTree_Classifier# Decision Tree Classifier Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to build and evaluate a decision tree classifier using the Iris dataset. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - The objective is to create a decision tree classifier using the Iris dataset.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Import necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`).
   - Load the Iris dataset from a local file.
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to ensure it is loaded correctly.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Inspect the dataset structure and features.
   - Generate summary statistics of the dataset.

4. **Feature Selection and Data Cleaning**
   - Select relevant features and the target variable.
   - Handle any missing values in the dataset.

5. **Data Splitting**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.

6. **Model Training**
   - Train a decision tree classifier using the training data.
   - Fit the model to the data and visualize the decision tree.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data.
   - Calculate and print metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

8. **Visualization of Predictions**
   - Plot the decision tree and visualize the decision boundaries.
